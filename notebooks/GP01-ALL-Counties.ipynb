    "Your groups have been assigned by Nationwide, and now it is time to begin working together to build towards your Capstone presentations! Your first group project will be to gather the additional county auditor data, clean it, merge it, and begin to understand it for those counties that are considered part of the Columbus Ohio MSA: Franklin, Fairfield, Licking, Delaware, Hocking, Madison, Morrow, Perry, Pickaway, and Union. We have already worked with Franklin, Fairfield, and Licking County auditor datasets during Unit 2, and will continue working with these datasets, but your job as a group is to combine all pf the county datasets together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A copy of auditor data for all of these counties is attached to this entry on Blackboard. Note that Franiklin, Fairfield, and Licking county data is not included since that data was already made available in Unit 2 Exercises. Additionally, Union County data is unavailable at this time - Bonus points to any team who can figure out how to get it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Group Project 1 presentations will be at the beginning of class on June 20, and are to be 10 minutes or less in length. Presentations for this first group project can be done by one ore more members of the group. You will be graded on the following for this first group presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Presentation of basic statistics and charts showing how your team chose to sample (or not sample) data files, what format you stored it in, and any interesting facts you found while reviewing basic statistics about the data.\n",
    "- What your team would like to study next about the data.\n",
    "- Presentation succinctness: less than 10min in duration, highlight main points, highlight any key questions or concerns about the data that your team had as you performed the work.\n",
    "Remember that this data can and should be used by your group during your Capstone work, so take your time building it well. This is your team's chance to perform its first practice run at presenting to an audience - enjoy it! The pressure to have robust data and impressive data visualization and modeling techniques can wait until your Capstone.\n",
